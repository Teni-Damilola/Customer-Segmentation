## Project Overview
--- - Adding line
Customer Segmentation is a typical strategy used by organizations to categorize clients based on their demographics, shopping patterns, or other traits. 
By conducting this project, I was able to leverage SQL's querying capabilities to segment customers effectively. This enhanced mytechnical skills in data analysis and also provided actionable insights that can drive business actions.
I was also able to answer some questions that will be effective to improving customer service, personalize marketting efforts and optimize inventory management. The project proded a solid foundation for understanding and applying customer segmentation in a real-world context.
